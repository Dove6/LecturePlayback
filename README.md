# LecturePlayback
Real-time PDF and audio mixer written in Python 3

## Usage
A set of three files is required in order to run the script:
* a PDF file containing the lecture/presentation materials,
* an audio file to combine with the visuals,
* a plain-text file describing time points of slide changes

### Navigation
Key bindings:
* left arrow - seek 5 seconds backwards
* right arrow - seek 5 seconds forwards
* P, spacebar - pause/resume the playback
* O - show/hide OSD
* Q, Esc - quit the application

When OSD is visible, mouse-based navigation is available as well:
* click the pause/play button to pause/resume the playback accordingly,
* click on the progress bar to jump to the selected time position
